# MLSTM-DenseNet
This projects consists of a deep learning model for multivariate time series classification.
The model is a hybrid architecture based on DenseNet and Attention LSTM.

# Dataset
The datasets are downloaded from: https://github.com/titu1994/MLSTM-FCN/releases

# Credits
This project is inspired and would not have been possible without the work done in:
